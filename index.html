      <h1>What is Proton? üòç</h1>
      <p>
        Proton is a new tool released by Valve Software that has been integrated
        with Steam Play to make playing Windows games on Linux as simple as
        hitting the Play button within Steam. Underneath the hood, Proton
        comprises other popular tools like Wine, DXVK and Vulkan among others
        that a gamer would otherwise have to install and maintain themselves.
        This greatly eases the burden for users to switch to Linux without
        having to learn the underlying systems or losing access to a large part
        of their library of games. Proton is still in its infancy so support is
        inconsistent, but regularly improving.
